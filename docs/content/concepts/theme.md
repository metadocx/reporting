# Theme

Metadocx reporting allows you to render your report using different themes. Themes will change the color scheme and cover page of your report.

All theme files are available in the js/templates folder. A theme is basicly a JavaScript class that extends the base Theme class and offers some functions to generate CSS and HTML for the report viewer.

## Custom Themes

It is possible to create a custom theme, checkout the Theme1.js or Theme2.js files for an example of how to create a theme file in Metadocx.
