## The flow

The Metadocx Application will be initialized when the web page is loaded. This will create a ReportViewer object that will render the report viewer interface within a specific element of your web page (#metadocx-report by default). 

The report viewer will load the report definition file, a json metadata file, and render the report within the report viewer interface.

All options, settings and data are defined within the report definition file.
