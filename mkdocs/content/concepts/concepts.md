# Metadocx Overview

## The flow

The Metadocx Application will be initialized when the web page is loaded. This will create a ReportViewer object that will render the report viewer interface within a specific element of your web page (#root by default). 

The report viewer will load the report definition file and render the report within the report viewer interface.

All options or settings can be defined within the report definition file.
