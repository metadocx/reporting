# License

## Commercial License
If you want to use Metadocx Reporting to develop non open sourced sites, themes, projects, and applications, the Commercial license is the appropriate license. 
With this option, your source code is kept proprietary. Which means, you won't have to change your whole application source code to an open source license.

## Open source license
If you are creating an open source application under a license compatible with the [GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt), you may use Metadocx Reporting under the terms of the [GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt).

You will have to provide a prominent notice that Metadocx Reporting is in use. The "powered by Metadocx" displayed in the report viewer in the lower right corner must stay present and visible to users.
The credit comments in the JavaScript and CSS files should be kept intact (even after combination or minification).
